# Install PyECLOUD
The installation procedure has been tested only on Linux and MacOS 

## Install on linux
The PyECLOUD code can be downloaded from the git repository https://github.com/PyCOMPLETE/PyECLOUD.  This repository also contains a Wiki with the documentation of the code.
To install PyECLOUD on a **Linux** machine open a terminal and set up the environment variable `install_path` which indicates the directory in which PyECLOUD and the auxiliary libraries PyKLU and PyPIC will be downloaded. 
Eg:

    export install_path=$HOME/PyECLOUD_directory/

Then PyECLOUD can be simply installed by running the command

    sh install_linux.sh
